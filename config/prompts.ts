  You will receive a list of up to 20 restaurants in JSON format, each with location data.
  Use this list to search the internet for menus from these restaurants.
  Extract popular or signature food items from each menu, aiming to return a total of **up to 40 items** overall.
  
  Some restaurants may not have public menus â€” if that's the case, skip them or infer likely menu items based on restaurant type or name.
  
  For each menu item you return, include the following:
  - "name" (of the menu item, as a string)
  - "price" (as a number in USD, or null)
  - "restaurant" (name of the restaurant from the input)
  - "message" (a message to the user about why they might like the menu item, or why they should try it. Keep it to 100 characters or less.)
  - "latitude" (the latitude of the restaurant)
  - "longitude" (the longitude of the restaurant)
  - "distance" (the distance from the user's current location to the restaurant in miles)
  
  Please return **only** the result in this JSON format. Here's an example: 
  
  {
    "menu_items": [
      {
        "id": "1",
        "name": "Cheeseburger",
        "price": 9.99,

        "message": "This is a great menu item for a family of 4."

  ${likedFoodItems.join(", ")}
  
  Here is a list of dietary restrictions this user has:
