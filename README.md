# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

# NOTE: Go to the file "keep_track_of_tests.md" to find the next action item. 

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1. latitudeDelta only | radius = (latitudeDelta / 2) Ã— 111,000                                        | Simple, fast                       | Less accurate for wide/zoomed-out maps |
| 2. Diagonal (lat/lon) | radius = 0.5 Ã— sqrt((latDelta Ã— 111,000)Â² + (lonDelta Ã— 111,320 Ã— cos(lat))Â²) | More accurate, considers map shape | Slightly more complex                  |
